What is the difference between the :focus and :active pseudo-classes?

:focus represents the state when the element is currently selected to receive input and
:active represents the state when the element is currently being activated by the user.

For example let's say we have a <button>. The <button> will not have any state to begin with. It just exists. If we use Tab to give "focus" to the <button>, it now enters its :focus state. If you then click (or press space), you then make the button enter its (:active) state.

On that note, when you click on an element, you give it focus, which also cultivates the illusion that :focus and :active are the same. They are not the same. When clicked the button is in :focus:active state.
